= #DeployDB Web UI Design

Below is a rough outline of what a few of the key DeployDB web-based views
should entail.


== Developer View

*Goal:* Provide quick feedback to the status of a particularly versioned
Artifact as it progress through its deployment pipeline

== Manager View


*Goal:* Provide an overview of which Services, composed of which Artifacts, are
deployed into the available Environments
